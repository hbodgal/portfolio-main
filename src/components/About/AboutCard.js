            When I'm not busy scribbling code, I like to keep things interesting
            by indulging in IMDB top rated movies or series. I also like to meet new people and explore cusines through dining out or whipping up something exciting in my own kitchen.

            I am creative person who likes to keep on creating something new. I feel amazing when someone 
            somewhere is using a feature which I created and optimized with my intelligence and skills. (Let me Flaunt my skills!)
            I find myself drawn to technology and coding.<br/><br/>
            
            My latest
            <span className="purple"> education</span> is in
            <span className="purple"> Computer Science</span> from California State University Fullerton.

            After graduate, I have gained
            <span className="purple"> one and a half years </span>
            of experience working in a company in Stockholm, Sweden as a

            find me flexing my unit testing muscles with Jest and Vitest, and
            slowly but surely, I'm becoming a TypeScript lover! (Well, I'm
            getting slowely there...) You can find more of my work on my GitHub
            profile. */}
