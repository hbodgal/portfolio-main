          <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>I am naturally inclined to take <span className="purple"> initiatives and embrace challenges </span>
            that others might shy away from. I find excitement in trying new things

            My <span className="purple">confidence</span> in expressing opinions is coupled with a genuine
            openness to suggestions and alternative viewpoints. Whether sharing
            insights with seniors or asking seemingly 'silly' questions, I
            embrace the exchange of ideas as a pathway to growth.

            currently living in
            <span className="purple"> Fullerton, CA</span>.
            My latest
            <span className="purple"> education</span> is in
            <span className="purple"> Computer Science</span> from California
            State University Fullerton. I have{" "}

            end to end features from concept to deployment. Leveraging my
            experience, I have taught{" "}
            <span className="purple">Web Backend</span> to Senior year students
            at CSUF using Python, for a year.
            <br /><br />
            When I'm not busy scribbling code, I keep things interesting by
            either indulging in movies or exploring cusines
            through dining out or whipping up something exciting in my own
            kitchen.
            {/* Stack Web Development <span className="purple"> Bootcamp</span>.
            After graduate, I have gained
            <span className="purple"> one and a half years </span>
            of experience working in a company in Stockholm, Sweden as a
            Frontend Developer. When I'm not typing away at my computer, you can
            find me flexing my unit testing muscles with Jest and Vitest, and
            slowly but surely, I'm becoming a TypeScript lover! (Well, I'm
            getting slowely there...) You can find more of my work on my GitHub
            profile. */}
